## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to 

### Utilization of Bootstrap Library

### Responsive Website and Features

![What the about page looks like when resized](/assets/images/gifs/Responsive-Portfolio-AboutMe.gif "About me gif")
![What the contact page looks like when resized](/assets/images/gifs/Responsive-Portfolio-Contact.gif "Portfolio gif")
![What the portfolio page looks like when resized](assets/images/gifs/Responsive-Portfolio-PortfolioPage.gif "Contact gif")

The above three gifs demonstrate what the three pages look like when resized. There are a total of three different states that can be seen in each page. The first is for large screens \(992px and greater\). The second is for medium sized screens \(\<992px \>767px\). The third is for small and lower sized screens \(\<768px\).

At the start of resizing you will notice that the card \(main content\) does not change but the far left and right margins decrease. At the first breakpoint, the most noticeable change is card size shrinks.

The less noticeable change is the top navigation buttons collapse into a hamburger button. The what it looks like can be better seen in the two gifs below.

At the second breakpoint, the card takes up the majority of the width removing most of the right margin seen in the previous aspect ranges. The length of the forms in the contact page increase in length at the breakpoint as well.

The next important feature I added to this site is a fixed header and footer that remain at the top and bottom of the page respectively regardless of scrolling.

The final key I wanted to showcase in this project is how the links behave when you navigate to each page. In each page you will notice that the link for the given page will be both darker in color and disabled from clicking as seen in the gif below.

## Installation

Prerequisites\: None

Simply clone it from my repo\:

```
clone git@github.com:TommyWillen/Responsive-Portfolio.git
```

## Roadmap

In the future I plan to make a form that users can select the information from so that it reduces human error issues that the prompt window cannot handle.

I also would like to find a way to create a random password that has to include specific characters since many websites/organizations require it.
