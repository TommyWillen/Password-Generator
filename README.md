## Installation

Prerequisites\: None

Simply clone it from my repo\:

```
clone git@github.com:TommyWillen/Password-Generator.git
```

## Roadmap

In the future I plan to make a form that users can select the information from so that it reduces human error issues that the prompt window cannot handle.

I also would like to find a way to create a random password that has to include specific characters since many websites/organizations require it.
